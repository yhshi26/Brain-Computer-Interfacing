# Brain-Computer Interfaces

## Alternate names
Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) go by numerous names including:
- Brain–machine interfaces (BMI)
- Direct neural interfaces (DNI)
- Mind–machine interfaces (MMI)
- Neural control interfaces (NCI)

## What's a BCI?
A BCI is a technology that measures neuroelectrical activity and transmits it to an external device. For example, a BCI can interact with a computer for brain-controlled typing or a robotic limb for enhanced prostheses. BCIs have immense potential in their applications, being often used to learn more about, or augment cognition, sensation, and motion. BCIs come in various forms, ranging from non-invasive (EEG, EOG, MEG, MRI), to partially invasive (ECoG, endovascular) and invasive (microelectrode array) interfaces depending on electrode proximity to brain tissue[1].

## Current applications
BCIs are a relatively new technology and are not marketable, and therefore quite expensive. Because of this, BCIs are predominantly available to big companies and research institutes, with research-grade equipment developed and used by companies like Blackrock Neurotech, Neuralink, and Synchron. That said, as neural engineering enthusiast communities grow, open-source BCIs are slowly becoming more available for individuals to get involved.
