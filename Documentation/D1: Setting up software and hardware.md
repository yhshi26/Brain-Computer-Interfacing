# D1: Setting up software and hardware

## Software:
- Download Emotiv Launcher and EmotivBCI software

## Hardware: 
- Charge Epoc+ headset for 4 hours
- Open electrode box and wet electrodes while mounted in box with saline solution
	- Electrodes should be saturated, we found 5 drops to of saline solution to work 
	- Setting up the headset can lose a lot of saline solution (to evaporation/absorption from hair), but saline solution can easily be made using salt and water (find exact measurements online)
- Place electrodes into headset and rotate clockwise until there's a faint click

## Mounting:
- Place headset on user (will require external help)
	- Hair should be out of the way of electrodes, ensure they are making contact with skin
	- Hair might absorb saline solution from the electrodes, so have extra saline solution available

> Note for next time: bring a cup, water, and salt to prepare a saline solution and soak electodes more effectively
