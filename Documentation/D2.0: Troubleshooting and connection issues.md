# D2.0: Troubleshooting and connection issues

## Connecting hardware and software
- Set up electrodes in headset, plug in USB dongle, turn on headset (in that specific order)
- Connect Emotiv Epoc+ to Emotiv Launcher (then open whichever software to be used, e.g. EmotivBCI)

## Issues 
- There were connectivity issues using the USB dongle to connect Emotiv Epoc+ to Emotiv Launcher
  - The USB cable can be used alternatively but it did not fully work

### Troubleshooting
- LED indicators can be used to troubleshoot connection issues available on [this page](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/epoc-user-manual/using-headset/led-indicators) in the [user manual](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/epoc-user-manual/)
- Actions:
  - Power off/battery flat: power LED off and charging LED off
  - Power on: power LED on and charging LED off
  - USB connected/charging: power LED off and charging LED orange
  - Charging complete: power LED off and charging LED green
  - Firmware failure: power LED fade-on-fade-off and charging LED off

> We specifically experienced something close to a firmware failure indication with the power LED fade-on-fade off and charging LED fade-on-fade-off
> 
> We have emailed customer support regarding this and will continue troubleshooting in the meantime
