# D2.1: Troubleshooting and connection issues
- Went through [guide to connect headset](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/emotiv-launcher/devices/connecting-your-headset)
- Bluetooth connection on Windows (3):
    1. Unpaired mode: no connection
    2. Paired mode: no connection
    3. USB receiver dongle: Windows detected a connection, but there was still no connection

## Eliminated possibilities
- Software has been updated, therefore not software issue
- Firmware has been updated, therefote not firmware issue
- Changed computers, therefore not a computer issue

## Other possibilities
- Low battery, not sure if we charged properly
- Hardware issue (in which case we'd need to try another headset but that would be pain)
